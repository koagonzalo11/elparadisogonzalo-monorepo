Solidity is similar to Javascript, but also has similarities with C++. If you are new to object oriented programming languages like C++, and are unfamiliar with any terms that you encounter, then you can refer to this glossary or to an educational website for C++ such as [learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com). Alternatively you can learn Python first (e.g. with [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) or [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://www.learnpythonthehardway.org/), which I found to be rather condescending), then Javascript (e.g. with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)), then C++, since Python is the easiest to learn, and C++ is the hardest of these three.

The following glossary list is ordered roughly from the simplest to the most complex. Topics at the top of the list tend to be a precursor to understanding topics later in the list.

1. [Logical operators](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/36-logical-operators/)
2. [Relational operators](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/35-relational-operators-comparisons/)
3. [Assert](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/7-12a-assert-and-static_assert/)
4. [Keccak](http://keccak.noekeon.org/specs_summary.html). Note that Solidity doesn't use the newest specification available, it uses the one submitted to the SHA3 competition.
5. [Ripe MD](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html)
