As part of an ongoing effort to update and overhaul the Ethereum wiki to make it more useful to our community, the JavaScript API has now moved to the following location:

[web3js.readthedocs.io](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.9/)

Formally this page referenced the web3.js API for 0.2x.x. Those docs can now be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/blob/0.20.7/DOCUMENTATION.md).
